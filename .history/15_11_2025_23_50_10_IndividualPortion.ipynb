The \"sessions\" table has one row per play session and records the start and end time of the session. Using the times given from the \"sessions\" table, I created the variable 'duration_min' that measures how long each session lasted in minutes. \n",

Then, I joined the tables together to form the variable 'data_analysis'. Players with a missing age or no recorded sessions were dropped as they had nothing to be calculated. Conclusively, most players in the 'data_analysis' were teenagers or young adults (with a few outliers). Their session lengths had variety with there being many short sessions and a few longer ones."
